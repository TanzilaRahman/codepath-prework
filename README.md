APP Brainstorming:

My favourite applications and their features:

1. Instagram: 

    a)Reacting to individual messages with emojis of the users choice (‚ù§Ô∏è, ü§£) etc
    
    b)Being able to select the desired portion of music to put in stories on instagram such as (0.40 sec to 0.55 seconds)
    
    c)Hiding stories from certain followers in the stories settings
    
2. WhatsApp:

    a)Being able to search for words/phrases in chats and instantly finding it
    
    b)The screen Lock feature under privacy in settings
    
    c)Being able to select images/ videos / links / audios/ and texts at the same time and forwarding it at once is a very helpful feature
    
    d) being able to lock individual chats (added privacy) is an interesting feature
    
3. TikTok:

    a) Feature that lets user save videos in the app and create individual folders called "collection"; it helps organizing it by types such as "recipies" , "Podcast stories" etc
    
    b) Being able to save any comments under any videos, as well as saving sounds, and filters(popular feature)
    
    c) Feature to post with "only me" as the viewer
    
    d) The feature for "who can see your following list?" options for "only me" adds more privacy. 
    
    
App Idea:

Trip Planner App: An app that will let users plan trips in advance. Users can create individual trips with date and name them. Inside each board, they can add informations such as list of places to visit with names and address: Restaurants/ hotels / tourist attraction places/ Movie theatre, or add customized activities, sports, events as they desire with time (duration) of the day. They can add pdf's or images of tickets so its easily accessible through the planner app.

Other key feautures: Users can share their plan board with others easily. They can add contacts of people that will be joining them in the trip. They can also save other key information relating to the trips. (extra directions, reminders etc) all in advance.
